The questions is here: how can we use the new cloud-native toolset to administer and manage Hadoop based clusters? Is there any benefit to run Hadoop and other bigdata application on top of Kubernetes?\n\nIn this presentation I will show that Hadoop is not a legacy application but it could be run very easy in cloud-native environment thanks to the generic and distributed by design.\n\nThe first step to run an application in a Kuberrnetes cluster is containerization. Creating containers for an application is easy (even if it’s a goold old distributed application like Apache Hadoop), just a few steps of packaging. The hard part isn't packaging: it's deploying\n\nHow can we run the containers together? How to configure them? How do the services in the containers find and talk to each other? How do you deploy and manage clusters with hundred of nodes?\n\nModern cloud native tools like Kubernetes or Consul\/Nomad could help a lot but they could be used in different way.\n\nIt this presentation I will demonstrate multiple solutions to manage containerized clusters with different cloud-native tools including kubernetes, and docker-swarm\/compose.\n\nNo matter which tools you use, the same questions of service discovery and configuration management arise.

It is also a common practice to execute a more comprehensive set of tests when a version is prepared to be released.

This talk discusses testing methods for projects with legacy code, and how they can shape code and improve productivity. We will differentiate two different test methods, and use Apache CloudStack (ACS) context as a use case.",

In the belief that many CloudStack deployments are out there and many would be legacy technology based like e.g. deploying linux bridges for networking, at Nuage Networks we invested in API support to assist in the migration (or transforming) of guest networks from one physical network to another while preserving their deployed workloads. The team successfully integrated this work into ACS 4.11. The presentation will provide the technical overview of how that is realized and showcase an orchestrated migration from linux bridging to Nuage Networks SDN in a deployed Apache CloudStack cloud.",

ORC is a self-describing type-aware columnar file format designed for Hadoop workloads that provides optimized streaming reads, but with integrated support for finding required rows quickly. In this talk, we will outline the progress made in Apache community for adding fine-grained column level encryption natively into ORC format that will also provide capabilities to mask or redact data on write while protecting sensitive column metadata such as statistics to avoid information leakage. The column encryption capabilities will be fully compatible with Hadoop Key Management Server (KMS) and use the KMS to manage master keys providing the additional flexibility to use and manage keys per column centrally.

Software engineers should consider not only the demanding requirements of scalability, operations, programmability and usability, but also they should accommodate new requirements like 'real-time processing aka streaming' for latency, system portability for operations, support multiple programming languages and machine learning frameworks for data scientists, among others.\n\nIn this talk we discuss the dimensions of evolution and show that an evolvable big data architecture should rely on Apache based systems. We validate this argument by following an use case based on Apache Beam to create a rich and reliable system. Beam and its unified model to express batch and streaming data pipelines cover also the portable dimension at the language and runtime level. Other Apache projects contribute to create a complete solution, from data stores like Kafka and Cassandra to execution systems like Flink as well as projects in the machine learning space.",

The old mechanism which users leverage is the volume snapshot feature as this has the feature set closest to that of a backup regime. i.e. images are stored on alternate location (although this may actually be the same physical array), it can be scheduled, and users can set how many backups can be kept. The volume snapshot mechanism causes a VM snapshot to be taken, then the required volume transferred to secondary storage from a hypervisor host in the cluster within which the VM resides. In the case of VMware, the image is compressed into an OVA by the SSVM. \nThis talk describes a framework for implementing plugins of third party backup vendor products into cloudstack. A highlevel SLA definition scheme is defined in terms of abstract methods that will be implemented by vendor plugins. In addition a set of implementation which are under development will be shown.",

Since it was designed for Yahoo!, which has tremendous traffic and a large number of services\/applications, Apache Pulsar has the following notable features by nature: Multi-tenancy, Horizontal scalability, Durability, High throughput, Low latency\n\nWe adopted Apache Pulsar to develop a centralized pub-sub messaging platform for all services\/applications in Yahoo! JAPAN. Multi-tenancy and horizontal scalability allow us to cope with a large number of services\/applications, called \"property\" in Apache Pulsar, on a single instance and increase the properties seamlessly, i.e., new properties can be added immediately without system stop. Durability, high throughput and low latency bring reliable real-time pub-sub messaging to users. Moreover, since Apache Pulsar has quite a simple Client API, users can develop their applications intuitively.\n\nWe have already provided our messaging platform in the production environment. It has been used so far by a lot of services such as Mail, Gyao (streaming video service), etc. We will introduce our actual use cases and show how Apache Pulsar works.\n\nBrief outline of our presentation:\n1.

                "description": "Pub-sub messaging systems like Apache Pulsar are being used for an increasingly broad array of data ingestion tasks. Traditionally, these systems have offered at-least-once delivery semantics, leaving the task of implementing idempotent processing to the users.\nThis talk will present a rationale for adding “effectively-once” semantics to Pulsar, which was achieved by adding a message de-duplication layer that can ensure those stricter semantics  with guaranteed accuracy and no performance penalty.\n\nApache Pulsar is a distributed pub\/sub messaging system that originated at Yahoo, where it has been powering many critical systems and user-facing products for several years.\n\nThe traditional API for Pulsar is derived from basic pub\/sub concepts, such as “subscriptions” and “consumers” that receive messages and “acknowledge” their processing. This model is very simple and yet powerful in that it allows you to build applications without needing to understand the underlying intricacies of the messaging system. The only drawback is that previous pub\/sub system offer only “at-least-once” semantics, leaving the task of eliminating duplicated messages to the application. \n\nSince the emergence of stream processing and more demanding requirements, messaging systems need to offer correct primitives to allow implementing “effectively-once” semantics end-to-end, in both the messaging layer and in the processing layer. Here, we use the term “effectively-once” to clarify that messages can actually be replayed multiple times in the presence of failure, though the effects of their processing will be equivalent to exactly once.\n\nThis talk will present the new APIs introduced in Pulsar to offer “effectively-once” semantics and will cover implementation details and performance testing results and provide examples of use cases that can greatly benefit from this new feature.\n",

Although building neural network is the core of deep learning, people usually underestimate other steps of deep learning, such as data pre-processing, training process visualization and hyper-parameter tuning. You will get a unworkable model if any of these step goes wrong. So it is essentially important to do all these steps carefully and effectively. But each step will involve different tools and technique, switching between them is annoying and inefficient. \n\nApache Zeppelin is a web-based notebook that enables data-driven, interactive data analytics and collaborative documents with SQL, Python, Scala and more. With its spark interpreter, you can do raw data pre-processing. With its spark interpreter, you can do raw data pre-processing. With its python interpreter, you can run most of the deep learning libraries. And you can visualize the training process and tune model hyper-parameter via its visualization capability. Besides that Zeppelin provide other features like multi-tenancy, collaboration, dynamic forms and etc. All these function will improve your productivity in deep learning.\n \nIn this talk, I will talk about how to do deep learning in Apache Zeppelin notebook via a simple demo including data pre-processing, building neural network, parameter tuning and monitoring training process. \n",

Most standards are articulated around data formats (Well Known Text, Geographic Markup Language, etc.) and web services (Web Map Service, Web Feature Service, etc.) Those standards enable data transfers between server machines, where data are stored, and client machines, where data are typically processed (except with Web Processing Service). But in a world of petabytes of Earth Observation data, bringing data to the algorithm is not always practical; there is sometime a need to bring algorithm to data instead. Google Earth Engine, Open Data Cube, OpenEO and Amazon lambdas are examples of environments where data are hosted and computed remotely. In those environments, the OGC standards for data transfers do not apply as much as in the \"classical\" situation. Consequently each cloud environment defines its own, non-standard API for handling geospatial data.\n\nThis presentation will show how an old OGC effort — GeoAPI — could apply to the cloud environment for some kinds of problems. An example of remote execution using the same standard API in both Java and Python languages will be shown. We will present advantage and inconvenient of using a standard API. In particular the perceived complexity of international standards should be weighted against the problems of popular simple alternatives. Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) will be presented as a GeoAPI implementation with a focus on new features, some of them resulting from evolution in standards.\n\nThis talk is aimed to peoples having an interest in international standards applied to geospatial data, their implementation in Apache SIS, and how cloud environments may impact those standards. This talk will introduce some advanced features like dynamic datums in spatial referencing, but mainly as illustrations of the expertise contained in international standards.",

Such models generate so many predictions that the output alone presents a big data computing challenge to interact with and learn from.\n\nResearchers at the Harvard Center for Geographic Analysis are working with the open-source, GPU-powered database MapD and Apache Kafka to provide true real-time, interactive access to NWM predictions for stream flow and ground saturation across the entire continental US and from present conditions to 18 days in the future. Predictions can be viewed prospectively, “how will conditions change going forward?” as well as retrospectively, “how did condition predictions evolve up to any given present?”. Water conditions can also be tracked in space and time together as storms move across the country.\n\nThe speed and flexibility of the GPU analytics platform allows questions such as “how did the stream flow prediction error change over time?\" to be answered quickly with SQL queries, and facilitates joining in additional data such as the location of bridges and other vulnerable infrastructure, all with relatively low-cost computing resources. MapD and other open-source high-performance geospatial computing tools have the potential to greatly broaden access to the full benefits of large-scale environmental models being deployed today.",

The presentation includes discussion of how open, consensus standards enable interoperability and interchangeability of open source software components. Highlights of open geospatial standards from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and other organizations is included.\n\nApache SIS provides data structures and methods for geographic features including coordinate reference systems, e.g., OGC WKT CRS2. Several projects are providing geospatial structures and methods for Apache Spark, e.g., how to apply Simple Features in Spark.  Several projects are addressing spatial indexes on gridded structures including building on Apache Projects and the related OGC DGGS.  Apache Science Data Analytics Platform (SDAP) enables fast analysis of oceanographic data.  A recent Location Powers workshop highlighted linked-geo-data building on Apache Projects.  \n\nOGC standards play an important role for data exchange, which is an area that is increasingly being addressed by the Apache community. For example running Spark on data stored in multiple Cassandra instances is facilitated by using geospatial data models provided by OGC standards. A similar advantage happens when publishing results after analysis.\n\nCoordination of geospatial topics increases data quality and reduces development effort. Coordination based on the use of open consensus standards provides stable and proven APIs and encodings for interoperability and interchangeability of software components. After a session at ApacheCon two years ago, a mailing list was established: geospatial@apache.org.  The presentation will conclude with an open discussion of geospatial projects across Apache.\n\n",

HBase 2.0 is the next stable major release for Apache HBase scheduled for early 2018. It is the next evolution from the Apache HBase community after 1.0. HBase-2.0 contains a large number of features that is long time in the development, some of which include rewritten region assignment , perf improvements (RPC, rewritten write pipeline, etc), async clients and WAL, C++ client, offheaping memstore and other buffers,  shading of dependencies as well as a lot of other fixes and stability improvements. We will go into technical details on some of the most important improvements in the release, as well as what are the implications for the users in terms of API and upgrade paths. Phoenix 5.0 is the next biggest release because of it's integration with HBase-2.0 and lot of performance improvements in support of secondary Indexes.

                "description": "Many enterprises have a need to store their operational data in a NoSQL database and either pre-aggregated or raw data in a distributed file system such as HDFS. In such a heterogeneous architecture, it is imperative to have a unified query capability where data from one type of data source can be joined with data from another type in order to perform advanced analytics. At the same time, for performance reasons, it is crucial to leverage the underlying indexing and partitioning capabilities provided by each data source. \n \nIn this talk, I will describe how Apache Drill provides such a unified SQL querying capability over both NoSQL databases and files in a distributed file system. It achieves this through an innovative extensible architecture where the underlying data source exposes the artifacts, such as data locality and parallelization information, that are needed by the Drill query optimizer and executor. \n \nIn the case of a NoSQL database, Drill provides a comprehensive framework to expose the index metadata (if the system supports indexes) which are then used to generate index-based plans. While in the case of file systems, Drill supports partitioning of files within a single directory or hierarchy of directories. Filter pushdown and partitioning pruning optimizations are applied to reduce the amount of data read from disk. The talk will also discuss certain best practices about the data layout and data modeling that enable the above optimizations and substantially improve performance.\n",

                "description": "Apache Spark has become the tool of choice for data engineers and data scientists for data discovery, data munging and pipelining, general ETL and many other kinds of scalable distributed data processing tasks. One of the key contributing factor for this success is the consistent and easy to use distributed framework supporting Scala, Java, Python and R and the ability to connect Spark to a variety of data sources. Some connectors come bundled with Spark while some are available as part of the ecosystem from other projects and vendors. However there is often a need to integrate Spark with a source, destination or system for which there is no available connector.\n\nThis presentation is geared to address that problem by providing an under-the-hood understanding of batch and structured streaming sources and sinks in Spark. Furthermore, attendees will be able to develop their own custom data sources and sinks as well as be able to understand and appreciate the source code and optimally use existing data connectors and integrations like that for Kafka.",

                "description": "Modern servers pack enough storage and computing power that just a decade ago was spread across a modest-sized cluster. To exploit the full potential of modern servers, which can be viewed as a data-center-in-a-box, one needs to fundamentally build into the underlying data platform mechanisms for a) unbounded intra and inter-operator parallelism, b) sophisticated query optimization techniques, and c) hybrid storage mechanisms. Apache (incubating) Quickstep is data platform that is built from ground up, and in a principled way, to meet this need. To keep the project focused, the project’s initial target is read-mostly in-memory data warehousing workloads in single-node settings. This talk describes the architecture and design of this initial version of Quickstep.\n\nThis talk will also describe results from a performance evaluation comparing Quickstep to newer systems like Apache Spark and traditional systems like PostgreSQL. Quickstep outperforms these systems by over 10X in most cases.\n\nThis talk will also discuss how the hardware trends point to higher storage and compute densities in individual servers. The natural consequence of this trend is that focusing on the Quickstep approach of “scaling-up” to exploit the full hardware parallelism is critical for the future of high-performance data platforms. This scaling-up approach is complementary to “scaling-out,” which is also on the Quickstep project roadmap, and this talk will also describe the initial plan for a distributed version of Quickstep.",

The capital cost of cryptographic security for every web site worldwide has been lowered from potentially thousands of dollars per year to zero. One of the trade-offs for the availability of these free certificates is that they are short-lived, making automated deployment of certificates an essential piece of any deployment plan. Let's Encrypt supports Apache httpd out of the box for single-command renewal and deployment on a single host, while with Tomcat it's more complicated.\n\nWe'll be discussing how Let's Encrypt handles domain-validated authentication, initial requests, and renewals, and how to automate the deployment process in your Tomcat-based environment with minimal downtime.

                "description": "At the past few ApacheCon NA conferences, there have been ongoing discussions about how to improve web application load balancing, making it better...and smarter. Generally speaking, load balancing is still pretty dumb:\n\nAre the backend servers up?\nAre they successfully responding to requests?\nAre they responding in a \"timely\" manner?\nAre any particular backend servers receiving more or fewer requests than the others?\n\nThis is usually about all the information a frontend balancer has to choose the \"best\" backend for a request. Sure, some applications may provide a custom check or status page that the frontend might use to look for specific status codes or response text to help make a \"better\" decision. More often than not, though, it seems that balancers often end up reverting to a default round-robin posture that may or may not be best for their backend applications.\n\nIn this session, we will discuss some of the ideas that have been shared and refined over the past few years. The goal of these proposals is to allow proxies and load balancers to make truly informed decisions by using specific server and application state information provided by the backend itself. This backend information may incorporate factors outside the web application itself, for example high resource utilization by other server processes or a number of requests originating on other frontends or external applications. This will allow the load balancer to truly make a \"better\" -- if still not the \"best\" -- choice. Furthermore, this information could also be used for other purposes, such as monitoring, graphing, and trending.\n\nOf course, as Linus has said, \"Talks is cheap. Show me the code.\" So, we will demo and test proof-of-concept code for Apache httpd and Tomcat. With products like these and others like Traffic Server on board, perhaps ASF projects can kickstart an initiative\/standard that will spread to other projects and vendors to make load balancers a lot smarter than they are today, industry-wide!",

However, the design of abstractions for data ingestion (IO) is rarely discussed. This is unfortunate, considering that reading and writing data is a fundamental part of data processing. In this talk we intend to close the gap by describing Apache Beam's philosophy for developing IO connectors. Beam is a new programming model for unified and portable batch\/streaming data processing.\n\nWe will discuss how Beam's IO connectors approach correctness (e.g. fault tolerance, error handling) and performance (scalability, throughput, latency), and we will introduce a key element of Beam's IO philosophy - the idea that IO is no different from other data processing, and should be expressed via the same programming model primitives and be subject to the same ideals of modularity. This approach not only dramatically simplifies the implementation of IO connectors, but enables new dynamic patterns and APIs that otherwise would be cumbersome or impossible, e.g. reading data whose location is computed by the pipeline itself, sequencing streaming writes to multiple systems, general-purpose streaming of new results of a repeated query, etc. In some cases this approach requires a new programming model primitive, \"Splittable DoFn\", which we also discuss - however, in general  it is not specific to Beam and we encourage other data processing systems to adopt these ideas too.",

Mission critical applications need effective failover strategies across data centers. Apache Solr offers Cross Data Center Replication (CDCR) as a feature from 6.0 and has added more features in subsequent releases.\n\nThe first part of session will center on an active-passive design model with one data-center as the primary and other data-centers as secondary clusters. The second design model centers on designing an active-active bidirectional setup such that both querying and indexing traffic can gracefully be redirected to the failover cluster.\n\nThe third part of session will center on an actual use case: An analytics application with high availability. We will discuss the improvements observed in terms of maintenance, performance, and throughput. \nThe session concludes with challenges and\/or limitations in the current design and what improvements are forthcoming for Cross Data Center Replication in Apache Solr.",

Have you ever wondered who actually pays for open source? Not just developers, but the whole ecosystem around major open source projects, either at a FOSS Foundation, independent or an open core project at a company?\n\nThe major software projects we all rely on are mostly hosted at Foundations like Apache, Eclipse, Linux, or Software Freedom Conservancy.  Those foundations provide a wide variety of support to project communities, including legal and licensing assistance, trademark management, event support, and more. As non-profits, these foundations rely on donors and sponsors for all of their work.\n\nSo who pays for all of this critical support for open source foundations? Come find out what companies are behind the popular open source foundations and major independent projects, and who's actually paying for all of the other support work that's done to keep the servers running, press releases coming, and license compliance work.\n\nSurprises are guaranteed; I know I was surprised when I realized how many different FOSS projects that Microsoft is an annual sponsor for, and what projects a few other companies supported with their cash.",

It means that no decision about an Apache project can happen outside of the community. Every decision must be consented to by the whole project community. But companies, who often pay the wages of community members, have secrets. They will undoubtedly want Apache projects to go in specific directions to benefit their own strategy. How do we manage these conflicting goals. \n\nSurprisingly, in a typical Apache project it isn't all that hard, though it does require a certain skill in translating internal strategies to Apache deliverables that will gain the support of the community.

Each of these clusters is powered by machines running in the cloud, and have different workloads and resource requirements. In order to ensure that we have sufficient capacity for running jobs, while also keeping costs down during periods of low usage, cluster-wide autoscaling is necessary. This talk will describe:\n\n* Our open-source cluster autoscaling tool for Apache Mesos, called ClusterMan\n* How we built a simulation environment for ClusterMan to test changes before they go live\n* How the simulator helped us understand recent changes to the pricing model for cloud computation\n* How ClusterMan's autoscaling has saved ~50% on our distributed clusters, while still ensuring sufficient compute capacity for tasks\n* How we are using the simulator and machine learning models to build predictive autoscaling signals",

We’ll cover various testing approaches such as all combinations, all-pairs, model-based testing and property-based testing. Finally, we’ll cover a few tips for writing testing DSLs.\n\nYou should attend if you want to learn how to leverage a scripting language to write powerful tests or if you want to learn about some improved agile testing practices and techniques.",
