= GUI Testing

The `impl` modules includes GUI tests based on http://arquillian.org/modules/graphene-extension/[Arquillian's Graphene] and http://jgiven.org/[JGiven]. 

It tries to facilitated best practices from Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) and Page Object Patterns.
JGiven produces a nice (static) HTML5 output that gives an overview of the tests implemented.

See `impl/src/test/java/org/dukecon/server/gui` for examples.

== FAQ

What do I write into the PageTest classes?::

Please place BDD style code here following the Given/When/Then pattern.

What do I write into the Stage classes?::

These implement the methods called in the PageTest classes.
They interact on a business level with the web pages.
They must not access the elements of the web page directly.

What do I write into the Page classes?::

Each Page class wraps a GUI screen. When a screen changes its layout or design (HTML tags, but same logic), you'll need to change only your Page class.
All your tests will stay the same.

What do I the Tag annotations for?::

Use these annotations to group your tests.
You'll find them in the output.

How do I run the tests from my IDE?::

Prerequisite: Please run a selenium server locally first.
You'll find a script inside this project's selenium folder.
Firefox needs to be installed on your local machine.
Have a look at arquillian.xml to re-configure this default.

How do I run the tests in the automatic build?::

Maven will run Surefire as part of the build.
Arquillian will run Firefox on your build machine.
+
In order to run a headless build, pass the following parameter to Maven to run all tested wrapped in Xvfb
+
[source]
----
mvn -Djvm="${WORKSPACE}/xvfb.sh" test
----
+
or start Xvfb before you start Maven.

Where do I find the automatic test reports?::

After you have run in the sub-folder `impl`:
+
[source]
----
mvn test
mvn jgiven:report
----
+
you'll find them in `impl/target/jgiven-reports/html`
